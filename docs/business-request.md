## ðŸ“„ Business Request

**From:** Sales Strategy Team, AdventureWorks  
**To:** Business Intelligence Analyst 

**Subject:** Sales Performance Analysis and Regional Trend Insights

---

**Background:**  
AdventureWorks has experienced steady sales growth, but leadership lacks a clear view of which products, regions, and customers are driving this growth. Additionally, sales patterns across quarters and territories are not fully understood, limiting strategic decision-making.

**Request:**  
We need a comprehensive sales analysis using the AdventureWorks sales data to help inform upcoming strategic planning. Specifically, we are looking for:

- A summary of total and average sales by year, product category, and region.
- Identification of our top-performing products and customer segments.
- Insights into underperforming regions or time periods (e.g., seasonal dips).
- Visual trends that highlight opportunities for growth or concern.
- An interactive dashboard that can be used by the sales and marketing teams.

**Deliverables:**  
- A Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters and slicers.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, YoY growth, and regional comparisons.
- A short written summary of key business insights derived from the data.
- SQL scripts used for extracting and transforming the data.

**Timeline:**  
Please aim to deliver a first version within 2 weeks for initial review, with a final version ready after feedback is incorporated.

**Outcome:**  
The insights will be used to realign marketing efforts, optimize inventory across regions, and shape the 2025 sales strategy.
