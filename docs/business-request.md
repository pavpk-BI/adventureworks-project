Hi Pavitra,

I hope you’re doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static Excel reports to visual dashboards.

Essentially, we want to focus on:
- How much we’ve sold  
- What products were sold  
- Which clients bought them  
- How things have trended over time  

Each salesperson handles different products and customers, so it would be really helpful if the dashboard allows for filtering by these.

We also track our performance against budget, so I’ve added the 2025 budget in a spreadsheet for comparison. We typically look two years back when analyzing sales trends.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Thanks,  
**Steven**
