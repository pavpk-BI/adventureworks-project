## ðŸ“Œ Business Demand Overview

AdventureWorksâ€™ Internet Sales division is experiencing challenges with outdated, spreadsheet-based reporting that lacks the agility and depth required for fast decision-making. Sales managers currently spend significant time compiling and interpreting static reports to answer basic questions like "What are our best-selling products?" or "How are sales trending month to month?"

There is a strong demand to transition from static reports to dynamic, visual dashboards using Power BI. The goal is to provide stakeholders with clear, self-serve insights into product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends across time and geography. By enabling better visibility, the company can improve marketing strategies, target high-value customers, and respond more quickly to shifts in sales performance.

This project addresses that demand by developing a Power BI dashboard connected to the AdventureWorks database, with intuitive filters and visuals tailored to non-technical users.
